# Assignment on SIA

#### As a 3rd year student taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Tehnology Major in Network Technology, I believe that upon hearing the phrase System Integration and Architecture, the first thing that comes to my mind is that it is all about system finalization and furnishing making it efficient and optimize for an organization and/or a business to use. Even so, I don't have enough knowledge regarding this course but i am more than willinig to learn more about this. 

#### Furthermore, what I am expecting in this course is that I'll be having fun academic encounter with you as well as our my blockmates therefore leading to a fruitful academic semester. Aside from that, all the learnings regarding Sytems Integration and Architecture will be beneficial enough for my future endeavors such as conducting my capstone project as well as when I will be out there pursuing the career I have learned at the four corners of our room.

#### Lastly, I am expecting that I'll be learning really a lot of things most especially about formal description, representation, and structure of a system. I believe that growth and development starts with a seed of knowledge. Learning comes through when we accept to learn things even if it is hard so it is an affirmation that even though this course may be hard, I will be more than willing to accept the challenge and learn through it.
